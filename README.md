# AirPods Sound Quality Fixer And Battery Life Enhancer For MacOS

Fixes sound quality drops when using AirPods with Macs.

It forces the default audio input (or any other you'd like) to be the built-in microphone instead of AirPods' microphone so MacOS doesn't have to mix down the output.

It also increases battery life because AirPods doesn't have to broadcast sound back.

The app runs in the menu bar.
